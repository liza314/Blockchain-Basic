# Blockchain-Basic 
simple implementations to understand the core concepts of blockchain technology. 

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a system that records transactions across many computers. It is decentralized, meaning no single person or group controls it. Each transaction is stored in a block, and these blocks are linked in a chain. Once a block is added, it cannot be changed without altering all the blocks that follow. This makes blockchain secure and trustworthy.

### Key Concepts:
- **Decentralization:** The blockchain is managed by a network of computers, not one central authority.
- **Immutability:** Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or removed.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are visible to everyone on the network.
- **Security:** Blockchain uses cryptography to keep data safe and ensure transactions are valid.

###Languages Commonly Used in Blockchain Development:

    Python:
        Python is widely used in blockchain development for scripting, automating tasks, and creating prototypes. It's also popular in the data science community, which can be beneficial for blockchain analytics and simulations.
        Libraries like Web3.py allow interaction with the Ethereum blockchain, making Python a versatile choice for developers.

    Solidity:
        Solidity is the primary programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Itâ€™s a statically-typed language that runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
        With Solidity, developers can create decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.
