# Blockchain-Basic simple implementations to understand the core concepts of blockchain technology. 

### What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a system that records transactions across many computers. It is decentralized, meaning no single person or group controls it. Each transaction is stored in a block, and these blocks are linked in a chain. Once a block is added, it cannot be changed without altering all the blocks that follow. This makes blockchain secure and trustworthy.

### Key Concepts:
- **Decentralization:** The blockchain is managed by a network of computers, not one central authority.
- **Immutability:** Once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or removed.
- **Transparency:** All transactions are visible to everyone on the network.
- **Security:** Blockchain uses cryptography to keep data safe and ensure transactions are valid.
